        "Chopin got his formal edu-ma-cation at the Warsaw Lyceum, then polished his craft under the wing of Joseph Elsner at the Warsaw Conservatory, soaking up all the tricks of the trade like a musical sponge.",
        "Those early days were jam-packed with lessons and concerts, with little Chopin flexin' his prodigious chops all over town, convincing everyone he was the next big thing since sliced bread (or since Beethoven's fifth, to be era-appropriate)."
