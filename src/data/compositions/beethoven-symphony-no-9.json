The dude had been deaf as a post for about a decade, but he didn't let that keep him down or quiet. Instead, he used his 'inner ear' to pen this epic and the music came from deep within - the deepest feelings of joy, suffering, and love.",
            "The world was going through massive changes too with the Industrial Revolution in full swing. This upheaval probably seeped into good ol' LVB's soul, impacting his creation - the Symphony No 9. It was like he was throwing down a challenge to all the strife, saying 'yo world, check this out!'. It was the rise of romanticism too, pushing artists to express super intense, personal feels in their work."

Beethoven was already known as the innovation whizz, and he pulled some serious stunts with this one. For starters, bringing in soloists and a full chorus into a symphony?! That was done diddly unheard of! This move made the 9th Symphony stand apart from any other piece during that era.",

Coping with relentless tinnitus, our man still pushed the envelope, writing intricate parts for instruments and voices, which was like a musical tightrope walk.",
