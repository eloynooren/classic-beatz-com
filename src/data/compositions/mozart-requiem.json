The geezer, masked by the shadows, commissions a Requiem - a Mass for the Dead - but he wants it on the down-low, no names, no fuss. Perhaps this strange request was spurred by the turbulent times of the late 18th century, a world wearied by the upheavals of the French Revolution."

His hard-partying antics and spending like there's no tomorrow had led him to some serious bread problems. The Requiem's baker's dozen of a paycheck was an offer he couldn't refuse. Little did he know that he'd be drafting his own cut-off event, his swan song."

The music evokes a chilling journey into the ether, sometimes serene, other times melancholic - it's enough to give anyone the heebie-jeebies."

            "The Requiem was Mozart's angel and demon. Its composition drained him, but it also brought forth some of his most touching music. Struggling with illness and the constant pressure from his mystery commissioner, the final product was left incomplete. As a last hurrah before his premature curtain call, his student S\u00fcssmayr stepped up to the plate to finish the gig."

It was the Age of Enlightenment, a period of rational thinking, but also the French Revolutionary wars and turbulent times. From this dichotomy, Mozart pulled off a philosophical masterpiece; an exploration of mortality veiled in the complex intricacy of his music. The sombre macabre resonated with the collective consciousness of an era in radical transition."

And despite this subdued debut, the word got out, and the masterpiece started shaking up the music scene."

It has redefined choral composition, inspired countless composers and remains a staple on concert programs worldwide. Not bad for a piece of music cloaked in shadows of uncertainty and death, right? Mozart's grave may read 'unfinished symphony', but his Requiem continues to echo long after the man and the legend."
