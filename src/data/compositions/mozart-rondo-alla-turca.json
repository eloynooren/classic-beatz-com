            "Mozart's been all ears about the Ottoman Empire, 'cause everyone's wild about all things Turkish. Cultural appropriation wasn't even a thing yet. So, he decides to add a bit of exotic spice to his tunes. That's when Rondo Alla Turca pops into his head, a musical cocktail with a twist of Eastern zest.",
            "The melodies are like a Turkish bazaar in his mind: colorful, bustling, and hella catchy. And just like that, his piano sonata gets a grand finale that's about to become everyone's encore fave. That's the birth story of Rondo Alla Turca, right off Mozart’s whimsical noggin."
