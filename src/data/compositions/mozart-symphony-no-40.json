For the uninitiated, the European continent was in the grip of the Enlightenment, a potent intellectual revolution extolling the virtues of Reason and Individuality. This cultural upheaval had left its mark on the world of music, sweeping symphonies into a dynamic new form expressive of human emotion and experience. And in this heady turbulence, W.A.

            "You got your strings laying down the base flavor, while the wind instruments throw in the spice.",
            "There ain't no solos here, though. It's a team effort, each instrument bringing something to the party to make this track as tasty as it is."

            "This turbocharged tour de force is like a roller coaster ride that whips you around corners with exhilarating speed, tossing you this way and that with tricksy rhythmic games and cheeky surprises. Unexpected jolts of emotional intensity ramp up the adrenaline, while the overall excitement leaves you pretty much breathless."

            "In the title, Allegro assai, ol\u2019 Mozza (Mozart, if you're not on nickname terms) is basically sayin', 'Strap in, folks, cause this ride is gonna be fast and furious'. Assai is Italian for 'very', and Allegro translates to 'fast' or 'lively'",

            "Then we bounce into a playful, contrasting section in B-flat major, before things take a turn for the chaotic in an unstable development section where the orchestra wrestles with the main themes.",
            "Finally, the recapitulation brings us back to the opening material, but with even more intensity - it's like being spat out the end of a roller coaster and realising you're right back where you started, but somehow everythin's changed."
