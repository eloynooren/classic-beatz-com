He was craftin\u2019 what would soon turn the world of classical music on its head \u2013 the Symphony No. 5.

            "Now on to how it\u2019s all made to fit together. Technically speakin', the 'IV. Allegro' is a sonata, but on steroids. Starts with an exposition throwing down the main themes, then comes a development where BB \u2013 that's Beethoven, for us homies \u2013 takes us on a magical mystery tour, exploring variations and contrasts. After that, we get a recapitulation, it\u2019s like BB saying, 'Remember what I played at the start? Here's a little deja-vu for ya.'"

            "In the exposition, the music hits you like a left hook, a white-knuckle, booming theme in C-Major. Don't get too comfortable though, 'cos right after, there's a softer secondary theme, like Beethoven's showing us his tender side. Then comes the development, wild and unpredictable, man \u2013 it's like a rollercoaster ride of quicksilver changes in key and mood. And finally, the recapitulation: the first theme comes back, but now it's the boss theme, large and in charge, like Beethoven declaring victory."

            "And who\u2019s pulling these musical punches? The whole symphony orchestra, each instrument doing its bit. String section brings power and depth, while the brass comes in with those triumphant, military-like rhythms, like a royal fanfare. Plus, don't get me started on that solo oboe \u2013 it's all like a catwalk model, strutting its stuff amid all the other musical muggles, adding a splash of sonic spice."

            "So, what you waiting for? Hit that play button, buddy. Let that 'IV. Allegro' sweep you off your feet. You may groove to it, tap your foot, or just sway gently, but trust me when I say you can't resist getting caught up in the triumph of Beethoven's Symphony No 5 'IV. Allegro'."
